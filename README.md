Listed below is a chart with the name of each care attendant and the name of each dog in thier care.  The program allows the manager to enter the total amount of time spent with the dog, the services provided to dog(bath, grooming or none), and a general note about dog's day and tempermant.  Once the manager is done entering all logs, the program will display all the logs grouped by care attendant. The program also provides you with a summary of the dog with the most care minutes.
